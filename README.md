# Global Airport Nexus - South Africa Node
> Strategic Airport Intelligence System

## 📋 Executive Summary
The Global Airport Nexus - South Africa Node is a strategic airport intelligence system providing a visual and tabular interface to explore airport data. It leverages a geographical map and interactive tables to present key information about airports, including their location, operational status, and related details. The system enables users to browse, filter, and export airport data, contributing to informed decision-making within the aviation sector. The "South Africa Node" designation implies a focus on or origin from South African airport data, but the system is shown to handle other regional data as well.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Interactive Geographical Map**: Displays airport locations using Leaflet, with marker clustering for efficient visualization of dense airport regions.
- **Sortable and Paginated Airport Table**: Presents airport data in a structured table with sorting and pagination for enhanced data exploration.
- **Data Export Functionality**: Allows users to download the current airport data set as a CSV file.
- **Dynamic Data Loading**: Loads and processes airport data from CSV files, enabling easy updating and expansion of the database.
- **Real-time Sync Status Indicator**: Provides visual feedback on the data synchronization status, indicating whether the data is loading, synced, or experiencing issues.

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture
**Stack:** React, Tailwind CSS
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Rendering/Logic**: React components manage the application's UI and logic. PapaParse is used for CSV parsing. Leaflet and react-leaflet are used for the interactive map.
- **Structure**: The codebase is organized into modular components (e.g., `Header.js`, `AirportMap.js`, `AirportTable.js`) responsible for specific functionalities, facilitating maintainability and scalability. Data is loaded from CSV files located in the `assets/misc/` directory.

## 🚀 Deployment & Usage
1. **Installation**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/global-airport-nexus-south-africa-node.git
   cd global-airport-nexus-south-africa-node
   ```
2. **Local Execution**:
   - This is a static web application. Serve the root directory using any static file server.
   ```bash
   # Python
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Node.js
   npx http-server .
   ```
3. **Open**: Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
